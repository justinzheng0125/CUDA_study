CUDA Programming Model
-> SIMT Architecture
	Single Instruction, Multiple Threads
	All threads shares same program code (instruction)  -> Kernel
	Each thread has its own register rate
	
How many threads / warps / blocks ?

CUDA Thread Hierarchy
-> Thread 
	basic processing unit
-> Warp
	32 Threads (32 threads are followed by 1 instruction)
	basic execution unit
	Controlled by the same instructions
-> Block
	Group of threads
	Threads in a block have different
	- thread IDs
	- - threadIdx (buildt-in variable)
	Can be 1D, 2D or 3D
-> Grid
	Group of blocks
	Blocks in a block have different
	- block IDs
	- - blockIdx (buildt-in variable)
	Can be 1D, 2D or 3D

Built-in Variables for CUDA Thread Hierarchy
-> GridDim
	Dimension of the current grid
	number of blocks in a Grid
-> blockIdx
	Block ID of the current thread
	block ID in its Grid
-> blockDim
	Dimension of the current block
	number of threads in a Block
-> threadIdx
	Thread ID of the current thread
	block ID in its Thread ID
